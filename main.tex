Overview: Best time to visit Japan
Japan’s climate can be distilled down into four distinct seasons (spring, summer, autumn and winter), and each is culturally important in Japan. Late spring (March to May) and late autumn (September to November) are generally the best times to visit Japan, when there is little rainfall, skies are clear, and temperatures are mild. What’s more, the delicate cherry blossom of spring and vivid hues of autumn leaves are visually stunning.

The colder months, December to February, are less appealing to most visitors which can make traveling at these times cheaper. As well as being less crowded and costing less, many of Japan’s highlights are even better in the winter months.

"...a cheerful Bastian strode into his chamber and dropped a stinking, scorched lion's head and suppurating snake carcass on his desk. Girl gasped.
'You killed her! Oh, you're so brave!'
Bastian winked and her cheeks flared red..."
